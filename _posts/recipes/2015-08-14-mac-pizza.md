Maccaroni Pizza is incredibly simple to make, it's tasty, and definitely cheap.

Feel free to tweak this recipe to suit your taste. It's pretty hard to mess this one up :)

###Steps
<em>Preheat oven according to your dough recipe.</em>

1. Prepare your maccaroni ( This is a good use of day-old mac. ) and set aside.
   - <em>I will post my Maccaroni & Cheese w/ Broccoli in a separate post</em>
2. Prepare your pizza dough
   - Instant dough is fine or you could pickup premade dough from the grocery store
   - I have also used this <a href="http://www.cooks.com/recipe/4e76o217/no-yeast-pizza-dough.html">one</a>.
3. Heat olive oil in a sauce pan ( whatever you have will do ) over medium-high heat and add spinach once warm.
   - I like to throw in a pinch of salt here.
   - Reduce heat if your getting too much sizzle.
4. Dice sundried tomatoes and add to wilted spinach.
5. Combine mac n' cheese with spinach and remove from heat.
5. Roll out dough and place on a baking sheet. Sprinkle garlic powder on dough. A little goes a long way!
6. Heat dough for 5-8 minutes to get it started.
7. Remove dough from oven and add your toppings.
8. Sprinkle cheddar chesse on top and throw back into the oven until your crust starts to brown.
   - Feel free to cook shorter or longer as you see fit!
